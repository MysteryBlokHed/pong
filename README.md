# Pong
A simple game written in Python using the PyGame module.

## Overview
This is a small game I just made because I was bored. All code was written entirely by me.

## Requirements
**Python v3+**  
If you don't already have it, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
**PyGame**  
Download using `pip3 install pygame`, or download the latest wheel [here](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/#files) and use `pip3 install (.whl file)`.

## Starting the game
Simply `cd` to the directory of the `__main__.py` file and run it using `python __main__.py`, or run `python` on the folder containing `__main__.py`.

## Controls
Player 1 (left) uses W and S to control their padddle, and player 2 is controlled by AI. If you want to play with two players, press F once you start the game, then control player 2 using the up and down arrow keys.
